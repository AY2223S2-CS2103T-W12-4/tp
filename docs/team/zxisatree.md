### Project: MediMeet

**MediMeet** is a desktop application for doctors to manage their patientsâ€™ details and appointment dates. It helps them manage their own appointments and mitigates the need for a personal assistant or appointment manager, while also saving costs in the process.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
	* Find details command:
      * implemented a `find_patient_details` command.
	* Edit appointment command:
      * implemented the `edit_appt` command.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=zxisatree&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2023-02-17&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
