### Project: MediMeet

**MediMeet** is a desktop application for doctors to manage their patientsâ€™ details and appointment dates. It helps them manage their own appointments and mitigates the need for a personal assistant or appointment manager, while also saving costs in the process.
Given below are my contributions to the project.
