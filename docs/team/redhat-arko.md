### Project: MediMeet

**MediMeet** is a patient appointment management system for individual practitioners and small clinics. With MediMeet, you can efficiently manage patient information and appointment information in one place, saving you both time and money. <br>
MediMeet combines the visual appeal of a GUI (graphical user interface) with the speed and convenience of a command-line interface. Our easy-to-use commands make it easy to add, edit patient information, appointments and so much more! <br>
