# Project: MediMeet

**MediMeet** is a desktop application that enables doctors to effectively manage patient details and appointments. It saves costs by reducing the need for personal assistants or appointment managers.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

### New Features implemented:
1. `Appointment` - model to store appointment details.
   * **What it does**: 
   * **Justification**:
2. `AppointmentCard` and `AppointmentListPanel` - UI to display appointment details such as date, time, patient name and appointment description.
3. `CalendarCard` to display appointments visually, with the ability to click on a date to view appointments for that date.
