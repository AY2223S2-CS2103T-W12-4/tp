</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. <br> <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> **:information_source: Finding your java version**: To check the default java version on your device, run `java -version` on your terminal. You should see a string with `11.x.x`. For more information, refer to [this guide](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html#cmdline).</div>

2. Download the latest `medimeet.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/releases/download/v1.2/medimeet.jar).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your MediMeet.

4. Open the `medimeet.jar` file by double clicking on it. If a dialog box opens asking 'How do you want to open this file?', choose 'Java(TM) Platform SE binary'. A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
    * If you are familiar with terminals and command lines, you can choose to open the file from a command line instead. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar medimeet.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui_placeholder.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all patients.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a patient named `John Doe` to MediMeet.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd patient shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
